# GitHub Actions: Developer Workflows, Use Cases, and Core Concepts

## What are Developer Workflows?

A **developer workflow** is a set of repeatable steps that developers follow to build, test, and deliver software. These workflows often include:

- Writing code
- Running tests
- Building artifacts or packages
- Deploying to staging or production environments
- Monitoring and maintaining applications

Workflows help standardize and automate software development processes to improve efficiency, consistency, and quality.

## Use Cases for GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions enables automation of developer workflows by allowing you to create custom workflows triggered by GitHub events. Common use cases include:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically build and test your code on every push or pull request.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Deploy applications to cloud providers, container registries, or servers after passing tests.
- **Code Quality Checks:** Run linters, static analysis, and security scans automatically.
- **Automation:** Automate routine tasks like labeling issues, managing pull requests, or sending notifications.
- **Scheduled Jobs:** Run maintenance tasks or data backups on a scheduled basis using cron-like syntax.
- **Package Publishing:** Automatically publish packages to registries like npm, PyPI, or Docker Hub.

## Basic Concepts of GitHub Actions: How GitHub Actions Automates Workflows

GitHub Actions allows you to automate workflows by writing YAML files that define:

- **Events:** Triggers that start the workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `issue_comment`, `schedule`).
- **Jobs:** A set of steps executed on the same runner environment.
- **Steps:** Individual tasks like running commands or invoking actions.
- **Actions:** Reusable commands or custom code packaged to perform specific tasks.

These workflows are stored in your repository under `.github/workflows/` and run automatically in response to the specified events.

## GitHub Events & Actions

### GitHub Events

Events are activities in a GitHub repository that can trigger workflows. Common events include:

- `push`: Triggered when commits are pushed.
- `pull_request`: Triggered when pull requests are opened, synchronized, or closed.
- `issue_comment`: Triggered when comments are made on issues or pull requests.
- `schedule`: Triggered on a cron schedule.
- `release`: Triggered when a release is published.

### GitHub Actions

Actions are the building blocks of workflows. They are reusable commands that perform specific tasks such as:

- Checking out code
- Setting up languages and tools (e.g., Node.js, Python)
- Running tests or builds
- Deploying code
- Sending notifications

You can use actions from the GitHub Marketplace or create your own custom actions.

## Sample Workflow Example

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```
